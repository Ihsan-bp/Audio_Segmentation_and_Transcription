        "I initially encountered challenges with audio segmentation and transcription. Adjusting parameters like silence threshold and minimum silence length helped increase the number of segments but resulted in inaccurate transcriptions. To resolve this, I adopted an alternative approach, where I transcribed the complete audio and then split the transcription text by punctuation marks. This approach allowed me to obtain accurate text-based segments, eliminating the issues I encountered during the audio segmentation. This experience taught me the importance of flexibility in problem-solving and the value of considering alternative methods when facing challenges in a project."
